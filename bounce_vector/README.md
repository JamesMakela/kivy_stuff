# Calculating a realistic bounce vector

The Kivy demos such as the pong game use a very simplistic method of
determining the bounce direction when a ball hits the paddle.
We would like to make the bounce a bit more realistic by calculating
the bounce direction when the ball hits any side of the paddle, and
even the corner of the paddle.

This is just a visualization of the bounce vector a paddle might make.

With the Kivi library installed in your Python environment, you can run the
program like this:

```
> cd <program_directory>
> python bounce_vector.py
```
